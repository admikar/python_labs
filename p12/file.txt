There is always Project Gutenberg [1]. I suppose there may be pros and cons to each, with Project Gutenberg being generally older books.

Fun trivia: I once took an NLP class and discovered that I could predict whether a text was written by Edgar Allan Poe or H. G. Wells with ~86% accuracy based on the presence of one word: "whereupon". The language had changed enough in 60 years such that that single word was no longer used.

I’ve noticed that “presently” (in the meaning “soon”) is one such indicator for post-WWII English.
British novels written in the 1950s consistently use “presently” to indicate a short passage of time. In the following decades it seems to have been removed from editors’ style guides and replaced mostly by plain old “soon”.

Wonder what other words that could be found that do something similar.
